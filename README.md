- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stavina74
- 👀 I’m interested in (christ this is hard to pinpoint as a serial hobbist) >0< (pingu in thought face) ... the confluence of LOTR, Dragons, DnD, Dreamworks and Disney. Also keen to be introduced to peripharls in tandem with these ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cyber security, javascript, SQL and python. I like to project hop.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on noob lvl repositories but frankly I'd be chuffed if I get good enough to give back :)
- 📫 How to reach me TBC
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My ears go red if I drink too much orange juice (too much = 500ml ish)
